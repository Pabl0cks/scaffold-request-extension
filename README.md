### Tailwind color scheme

SE2 Extensions currently do not allow custom tailwind configurations. You can manually replace the themes in `packages/nextjs/tailwind.config.js` by the code below to get the Request Network color scheme:
```
    themes: [
      {
        light: {
          primary: "#0BB489", // dark green
          "primary-content": "#F9FBFF", //White
          secondary: "#0BB489",
          "secondary-content": "#F9FBFF",
          accent: "#0BB489",
          "accent-content": "#F9FBFF",

          "base-200": "#217B64",         // Slightly lighter than base-100
          "base-300": "#196D54",         // Another step lighter, still very dark
          "base-content": "#F9FBFF",     // Light content on dark base
